          further provide cutting-edge expertise like coaching, camping,
          training and focused fitness to the youth. The talent hunt and sport
          league will provide equal opportunities for both men and women for
          performance optimization. The initiate aims social contributions of
          sports in the youth development of Pakistan and motivates youth to
          participate in sports and physical activities. The long-term goal of
          the initiative is similar to that of the Olympic movement i.e. to
          contribute to building a peaceful and better Pakistan by educating
          youth through sport practiced without discrimination of any kind and
          in the spirit of good sportsmanship, mutual understanding, friendship,
          solidarity and fair play. The purpose is to encourage participants to
          play an active part in promoting a genuine and lasting culture of
          peace, human rights and democracy using sport as a catalyst for
          change. As part of ongoing activities, HEC hopes to develop these
          young people to become equipped with the knowledge, skills and
          attitudes needed to live together in peace and harmony and to empower
          them to discover their talent and make the most of their potential.
